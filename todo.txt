Requirements:
    we should allow null values! So we can't call getDouble as standard behaviour!
    performance! fast! 
    size! small size!

To Do:     

. discovered a visualization bug in genvlin-plotter:
    the current value (in nlo) is correct e.g. 1e-3,
    but genvlin plots 1e-4 or somewhat smaller
. Problem -> in plotter: Pool contains XYDataInterface's (initXYData), 
    but MainPool contains their XYVectorInterface's (MainPool.createXYVector)
    should XYData inherit the id? or has its own?
. LivePlotPanel: don't autoscale if translating, zooming or dragging
. print title of x and y axis if specified
. right alignment of the y axis labels
. PERFORMANCE:
    drawMouseDistance is slow (called too many times)
    translating is slow: CoordSys.drawAxes => Axis.draw => Axis.drawScalers
. NumberFormat:
    if we change precision of numberformat we should change textoffset's in Axis   
    calculate how many scalers we need to avoid overlapping if detailed number format -> see CoordinateSystem
    can't display small values (10^-6)
    can't display y values (x, too?), which have only a small difference
. create an 'update thread' for plotter


21.05.07: 2h introduced generics: removed CollectionIDEvent, StringNumber, changed method return type of XYPool.add + VectorPool.add, changed: ID, Pool, MainPool, VectorInterface, DataVector, XYVector, XYVectorInterface; changed automaticScale so that we don't repaint again from paint(); fixed bug in DataVector.getMin/getMax
??.??:    ?h access xyData by string not by integer
07.07:    ?h allow autoscale so that all dataset visible and autoscale to any region
09.07:    ?h zooming has wrong color
15.07:    5h override paintComponent instead paint in GPlotPanel.panel; removed outcommented code in XYData; removed automaticScale for last added xydata set; commented out GPlotPanel.vectorChanged; new class LivePlotPanel good for gstpl and nlo; if we have mouse motion -> plotter seemed to block, changed amount of mousemotion events which could trigger a repaint and the repaint is very expensive; 
             added 'keep data points' checkbox to optionspanel; 
             added 'enable plotter' to reduce memory usage if user wants this
17.07:    1h new colors; faster translating plotpanel (formatting numbers is now faster)
27.07:    4h updated copyright information in source header; hide XYData with the XYDataInterface to add hidden, color, ... useful method from XYData
             added classes to decorate GPlotPanel with strings;
             added faster max/min to DoubleVector

08.01.2008 1h fixed bug (with popmenu) that makes it impossible to rescale a plot
